# Virtual Pet Shelter

Virtual Pet Class

Used the same attributes as previous assignment. The constructors
are the same except I replace species with description. The 3
attributes are hunger, boredom, and sleep (instead of water per 
directions).

Virtual Pet Shelter

This houses the Hash Map. User can feed all and put all to bed
with methods housed here. All pets were added to the shelter.
Linked the Virtual Pet Class.

Virtual Pet Shelter App

Added two types of scanners, one for String and one for whole
numbers (int). Now user can interact with shelter to pull information 
from the Virtual Pet Class. Created the game loop and refactors parts 
of it, as well as, the loop itself. Linked boolean from Shelter Class 
to validate the animals name in the shelter. Make sure to hit 0 when 
exiting the game for the cat walking away!
